# Customers and Products Analysis

Our analysis targets the following three questions utilizing `stores.db` as our database.

Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?
Question 2: How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?

We identify low-stock and high-performing products, segmenting them into respective tables to highlight optimal products for maximizing revenue. Vintage Cars, Classic Cars, and Motorcycles stand out as top performers with low stock, signaling a key area of focus for the business.

Next, we analyze customer profitability, segmenting them into high- and low-performance categories. For high-value (VIP) customers, we recommend maintaining satisfaction through rewards or deals. For less-engaged customers, we suggest strategies like targeted advertisements to boost engagement and performance within this group.

Lastly, we calculate Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) to inform future ad spending and budgeting for new customer acquisition. This metric provides a clear reference for optimizing resource allocation and strategic planning.

### Recommendations
- Prioritize restocking vintage cars and motorcycles while evaluating less popular products for potential reductions.
- Implement personalized marketing strategies for VIP customers and re-engagement campaigns for the least engaged customers.
- Leverage the LTV metric to guide budget allocation for customer acquisition.

### Methodology
This analysis leveraged SQL queries to extract actionable insights from a relational database containing customer, product, order, and payment data. Below are the main SQL queries used:

1. **Table Overview**:
   - Queried the number of attributes and rows in each table to understand the dataset's structure.

2. **Low Stock Products**:
   - Identified products with the lowest stock-to-order ratio to prioritize restocking.

3. **Product Performance**:
   - Calculated total revenue generated by each product to highlight the top-performing items.

4. **Profit per Customer**:
   - Computed customer profitability by aggregating the difference between sales price and product cost.

5. **Top VIP Customers**:
   - Segmented the top five customers based on profitability for targeted marketing efforts.

6. **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**:
   - Determined the average lifetime profit per customer to guide acquisition spending.
